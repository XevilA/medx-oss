Qt Real-time Medical Detection App ü©∫Your Quick Guide(Developed by: Dotmini Software - Tirawat Nantamas dev@dotmini.in.th)‚ú® What's it Do? (Features)Live Video: Shows you what your computer's camera sees. üìπPick Your Brain: Lets you browse and load your own Keras/TensorFlow model (.h5 file). üß†Know Your Labels: You can also load a text file (.txt) that tells the app what the different things your model detects are called. üè∑Ô∏èReal-time Detection: Once you hit start, it runs your model on the video feed live. ‚ö°See the Results:Draws boxes around detected objects directly on the video feed. üñºÔ∏èPops up a separate window listing all the detections with names, confidence scores, and box coordinates. üìäLooks Kinda Sleek: Uses Qt6 with a dark theme. üòéHandles the Heavy Lifting: Runs detection in a separate thread so the app doesn't freeze. üí™üöÄ Getting Started (How to Use)Get the Goods: Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:pip install PyQt6 opencv-python tensorflow numpy
(You might need tensorflow-cpu instead of tensorflow if you don't have a compatible GPU).Save the Code: Grab the Python script (the one ending in .py) and save it somewhere (e.g., qt_medical_detector.py).Run It! Open your terminal/command prompt again, navigate to where you saved the file, and run:python qt_medical_detector.py
Load 'Er Up:Click "Browse Model" and find your .h5 model file.Click "Browse Labels" and find your .txt label file (make sure the order of names matches what your model outputs!).Check the status bar at the bottom for loading messages.Hit Start: Once loaded, click "Start Detection".Watch the Magic:The main window shows the camera feed with detection boxes.A second "Detection Results" window appears listing finds.Stop When Done: Click "Stop Detection" to end the process.üõ†Ô∏è Super Important: Making it Work with Your ModelOkay, this is key. The code has placeholder bits for handling your specific model. You need to edit the Python script (qt_medical_detector.py) for it to work correctly. Find the DetectionWorker class and modify these methods:1. _preprocess_frame(self, frame):What it does: Gets the raw camera image ready for your model.Your Job: Change resizing dimensions and normalization methods to match your model's exact input requirements.2. _postprocess_predictions(self, predictions, original_shape):What it does: Takes the raw numbers your model outputs and turns them into useful info (boxes, classes, scores).Your Job (Most Critical!):Figure out how your model outputs bounding boxes (format, coordinate system).Extract class IDs and confidence scores correctly.Filter weak detections.Crucially: Convert relative coordinates (0-1) to absolute pixel coordinates.Add Non-Max Suppression (NMS) if needed.If this isn't right, you'll get no detections, wrong boxes, or maybe even errors!3. _draw_results(self, frame, results):What it does: Draws the boxes and labels onto the video frame.Your Job: Usually minor changes needed, just ensure the box format used for drawing matches what _postprocess_predictions produces.Seriously, if you don't customize those functions, the app probably won't detect anything correctly!‚ùì Quick Troubleshooting TipsNo Camera Feed? Check the CAMERA_INDEX constant in the script (usually 0, but might be 1 or higher). Make sure your camera is connected and not used by another app.Model/Label Load Failed? Double-check the file paths are correct and the files aren't corrupted. Look for specific error messages in the status bar or console.No Detections Appearing? This is almost always an issue in the _postprocess_predictions function. Review your logic there carefully! Also check the detection_threshold.Wrong Boxes/Labels? Again, check _postprocess_predictions for coordinate conversion errors. Ensure your label file order matches the model's output.App Freezes or Crashes? Look for error messages printed in the terminal where you ran the script. This often points to problems in the detection functions or library issues.üßë‚Äçüíª Developer InfoApp developed by:Dotmini Software - Tirawat Nantamasdev@dotmini.in.th¬© 2025 - Have fun detecting!
